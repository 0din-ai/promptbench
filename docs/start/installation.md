# Installation

There are two ways to install promptbench. If you want to simply use as it is, install via `pip`. If you want to make any changes and play around, install it from source.

We recommend to build virtual environment via [anaconda/miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment) or [python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) to better manage your python library.



## Install via `pip`

Simply run 

`pip install promptbench`

## Install via github

First, clone the repo

`git clone git@github.com:microsoft/promptbench.git`

Then, 

```cmd
cd promptbench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
